Kevin the Robot Dog is a quadruped I created for a final design project at the University of Notre Dame.

Check him out on Youtube:

For more information check out the final report written on Kevin.

- See Final_Report/Automation_and_Controls_Final_Project_Report.pdf

Future plans include:
- Bluetooth remote control
- reworking the entire wiring system (including custom PCB) and battery monitoring circuitry
- overhaul balance control with a more complex model (using analyital dynamics to generate EOMs) of the system & additional tuning
- possible force control? either though current sensors on servos or pressure sensors on feet
- googley eyes to make him cuter
- expanded motion capabilities (jumping, rough surfaces & inclines, possibly stairs)
